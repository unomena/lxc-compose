**Status**: Needs improvement
- **Purpose**: Documentation server (MkDocs or similar)
- **Key Features**:
  - Static site generation
  - Live reload for development
- **Port**: 8080 (auto-forwarded)
- **Needed Improvements**:
  - Add documentation
  - Simplify configuration
  - Add tests

### 6. SearXNG üìù TODO
**Status**: Needs improvement
- **Purpose**: Privacy-respecting metasearch engine
- **Key Features**:
  - SearXNG installation
  - Redis for caching
  - Customizable settings
- **Port**: 8888 (auto-forwarded)
- **Needed Improvements**:
  - Add comprehensive setup documentation
  - Optimize configuration
  - Add health checks

## Common Improvements Applied

### 1. Configuration Comments
Each lxc-compose.yml file now includes:
- Header section explaining the application architecture
- Inline comments for every configuration option
- Examples of production vs development settings
- Links to relevant documentation

### 2. Package Optimization
- Removed unnecessary packages like vim, htop, net-tools
- Only essential packages for application functionality
- Leveraged library services (python3, supervisor, etc.)

### 3. Test Scripts Enhancement
Each test script now includes:
- **Internal tests**: Run inside container
  - Service health checks
  - Dependency verification
  - Process monitoring
  - Resource usage checks
- **External tests**: Run from host
  - Port accessibility
  - API functionality
  - Performance metrics
  - Security validation
- **Port forwarding tests**: Verify network rules

### 4. Best Practices
- Use of includes for common services
- Automatic supervisor inclusion for services
- Environment variable management via .env files
- Proper error handling in post_install scripts
- Clear separation of development and production configs

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing
Use the provided test script to validate all samples:
```bash
chmod +x /tmp/test_all_samples.sh
/tmp/test_all_samples.sh
```

### Manual Testing
For each sample:
1. Deploy: `lxc-compose up`
2. Test: `lxc-compose test`
3. Access: `curl http://localhost:<port>`
4. Logs: `lxc-compose logs <container>`
5. Clean: `lxc-compose down && lxc-compose destroy`

## Port Forwarding Issues

### Known Issue
Port forwarding from localhost may not work in some network configurations. This appears to be related to iptables FORWARD chain policies or Docker interference.

### Workaround
Access applications directly via container IP:
```bash
# Get container IP
lxc list <container-name> -c 4 --format csv

# Access application
curl http://<container-ip>:<port>
```

### Permanent Fix
Investigate and fix the localhost port forwarding issue in the core lxc_compose.py implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete improvements for remaining samples (Django, Node.js, etc.)
2. Fix port forwarding to localhost issue
3. Add CI/CD testing for all samples
4. Create video tutorials for each sample
5. Add more complex multi-tier application examples

## Contributing

When adding new samples:
1. Follow the established comment structure
2. Include comprehensive tests
3. Document all environment variables
4. Provide both development and production configurations
5. Test on clean system before committing
